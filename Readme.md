This is the ultimate project from the fullstack web development nanodegree

This webserver was made in digitalocean 

The ip of the project is 157.230.144.83 and connects on port 2200
but you can access to it (and I suggest you to do so ) from _**http://catalogos.me**_


The software I use for the project was 
* _Flask_
* _SQLAlchemy_
* _Flask-SQLAlchemy_
* _Flask-Migrate_
* _Flask-Login_
* _requests-oauthlib_
* _psycopg2_
* _pip_
* _git Bash_
* _postgresql_ 
* _libapache2-mod-wsgi python-dev_


The changes of the configuration were :
* Change port ssh from 22 to 2200
* Create a new user (grader)
* Give sudo access to the grader user
* Enable firewall with the new port and local timezone
* To disable root login and password-login

I use several articles in order to finish this project this were the most helpful
